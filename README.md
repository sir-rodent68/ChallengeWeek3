# Week 3 Challenge: Password Generator

## The Project

```

This week's challenge was to modify given starter code into a password genorator, in order to do this I had to do 3 things. 

```

 * 1st: Set up a randomizer function to get random numbers for the length and the characters.

* 2nd: Get user input for their desired minimum and maximum as well as what type of characters they would like in their password.

* 3rd: Use randomizer function along with set up arrays to randomize each character in the password based on the user input too create a completely randomized password.



## The Final Product

```

After working on the code for several hours I have a site that I feel confident posting as my final product, it has the functionality to be able to generate passwords randomly with or without uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
